Reported in association with Brugada syndrome (Rook 1999, Deschnes 2000, Meregalli 2009, Crotti 2012). In vitro functional studies show a potential impact (Rook 1999, Deschnes 2000), however these may not be representative of in vivo protein function. [BS1 + PP3],SCN5A

Only pathogenic in ClinVar by 'literature only'. Identified in siblings but no solid segregation data (Hayashi  2004). Functional studies in yeast show the variant leads to an increase in the ability of TCAP to bind with titin and CS-1 (Hayashi 2004)- in vitro assay may not accurately represent biological function.  Amino acid change is not conserved - 7 mammals carry the variant amino acid. [BS1 + BP4],TCAP

Reported in >10 individuals with HCM and segregated in 5 affected individuals from multiple families (Watkins 1995, Elliott 1999, Garcia-Castro 2003, Torricelli 2003, Van Driest 2003, Theopistou 2004, Ingles 2005, Zeller 2006, Garcia-Castro 2009, Kaski 2009, Gimeno 2009, Millat 2010). Up to half of individuals carried a second variant (ClinVar SCV000060277.4). Residue not evolutionarily conserved. A milder affect with late age of onset has been suggested. In vitro studies suggest may have an affect on muscle contraction (Morimoto 1999, Yanaga 1999, Szczesna 2000, Hernandez 2005) however these might not represent acurately protein function. [BS1],TNNT2
