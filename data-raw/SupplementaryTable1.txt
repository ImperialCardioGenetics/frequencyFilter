43475*	MYL2	c.401A>C	19	VUS	8/8 missense prediction algorithms predict deleterious. Identified in 2 individuals with a second 'likely pathogenic' MYL2 variant (ClinVar SCV000060059.4).  An in vitro functional study suggests that this variant may reduce cardiac muscle contraction efficiency (Burghardt 2013). Second hit causing more severe phenotype suggested. [BS1 + PP3]
43121*	MYL3	c.170C>A	14	Likely Benign	8/8 missense algorithms predict deleterious. Mutations at the same residue have been reported for HCM (Lee 2001). Indentified along with with pathogenic and likely pathogenic variants (ClinVar SCV000059671.4, SCV000207109.1). 2 affected siblings reported both with variant as homozygote (no support for recessive MYL3 inheritance). [BS1 + BP5 + PP3]
180694	MYOM1	c.1900+3A>C	466	Likely Benign	Originally identified as a homozygote in 3 yr old (ClinVar SCV000195854.1). No other data to support. 7 homozygotes in ExAC. Splicing tools predict no effect. [BS1 + BP4]
41926	CRYAB	c.460G>A	93	Likely Benign	Identified in a HCM case with an alternative variant sufficient to cause disease (ClinVar SCV000060874.4). Previous pathogenic assertion in ClinVar is from 'literature only' for DCM (no segregation, only 200 controls used for reference). All others say 'VUS' [BS1 + BP5]
12411	TNNT2	c.853C>T	40	VUS	Reported in >10 individuals with HCM and segregated in 5 affected individuals from multiple families (Watkins 1995, Elliott 1999, Garcia-Castro 2003, Torricelli 2003, Van Driest 2003, Theopistou 2004, Ingles 2005, Zeller 2006, Garcia-Castro 2009, Kaski 2009, Gimeno 2009, Millat 2010). Up to half of individuals carried a second variant (ClinVar SCV000060277.4). Residue not evolutionarily conserved. A milder affect with late age of onset has been suggested. In vitro studies suggest may have an affect on muscle contraction (Morimoto 1999, Yanaga 1999, Szczesna 2000, Hernandez 2005) however these might not represent acurately protein function. [BS1]
177700	MYBPC3	c.2441_2443delAGA	39	VUS	In-frame deletion. Experimental studies have shown that this deletion does not lead to decreased MYBPC3 stability in vitro (Bahrudin 2008). Has been identified in 4 adult unaffected relatives (ClinVar SCV000203960.3). [BS1 + PM4]
14064	MYL2	c.37G>A	37	Benign	ClinVar 'Pathogenic' assertion from literature only (ClinVar SCV000035365.1). Not found in an affected family member (Ball 2012). Other weak non-segregation data. Found in a 56 year old healthy individual (Ball 2012). Found in Ashkenazi Jewish individuals. Reported to lead to increased Ca2+ affinity (Szczesna 2001). [BS1 + BS4]
161310	MYBPC3	c.961G>A	37	Likely Benign	Evidence based on presence in HCM individuals (1 with a MYH7 variant (Maron 2012)) and absence in ESP and nearby residues reported as pathogenic (Ser311Leu and Arg326Gln). No segregation or functional data. Reported multiple times in ClinVar with other variants that could explain phenotype (SCV000208258.4, SCV000261724.2). [BS1 + BP5]
177902	MYBPC3	c.1000G>A	36	VUS	Very high Asian freqeuncy (0.45% in ExAC). Reduced stability of MYBPC3, higher Ca2+ transients and action potential durations in HL-1 cells and rat cardiac myocytes (Bahrudin 2011). [BS1]
161305	MYBPC3	c.13G>C	36	Likely Benign	Reported in two families; one individual but not unaffected mother and another individual but not unaffected sibling. 3 individuals with variant also carry a pathogenic mutation in the same gene (ClinVar SCV000198995.3). Amino acid not conserved in mammals. [BS1 + BP5]
191577	ANKRD1	c.368C>T	28	Likely Benign	8/8 missense algorithms predict benign. Mutant protein correctly incorporates into the sarcomere (Crocini 2013). Amino acid change is not conserved. [BS1 + BP4]
14149	MYH6	c.3195G>C	28	VUS	6/7 missense algorithms predict deleterious. Originally identified as in an affected (died of congestive heart failure at 45 yrs) and not his 2 unnafected offspring or 150 controls (Carniel 2005). Amino acid change seen in birds. [BS1 +  PP3]
12445	TNNC1	c.435C>A	28	VUS	Functional studies using mutant porcine cardiac skinned fibers showed significantly increased force development and force recovery compared to wildtype (Landstrom 2008) with reduced Ca2+ binding [only in vitro studies]. No segregation data. Has also been reported in a patient with idiopathic DCM who also harbored a missense variant in MYBPC3 gene (Pinto 2011) [BS1]
42900	MYH7	c.2360G>A	27	Likely Benign	11 reports in total (7 literature, 4 LMM in ClinVar (SCV000059440.4)), majority South Asian decent - very high South Asian frequency (0.1%). 3 probands had another variant sufficient to cause disease. Only moderately conserved amino acid. Possible non-segregation (not in the father of an individual who died of sudden cardiac death; ClinVar SCV000059440.4). [BS1 + BP5]
43911	ACTN2	c.1484C>T	26	Benign	4 individuals in the literature (Chiu 2010, Theis 2006) and 2 reported on ClinVar (SCV000060535.4). Non segregation with disease also reported (2 affecteds; ClinVar SCV000060535.4). No supporting segregation data. [BS1 + BS4]
42536	MYBPC3	c.1468G>A	25	Likely Benign	7/7 missense algorithms predict deleterious. Identified in individuals with HCM, DCM and LVNC. Conserved residue. Multiple reports of cooccurance with an alternative variant that is sufficient to cause disease (ClinVar SCV000059050.4). [BS1 + BP5 + PP3]
31766	MYL2	c.141C>A	22	Likely Benign	7/8 missense algorithms predict benign. Co-occurance with likely pathogenic (tested) MYH7:c.5134C>T mutation (segregation data) in literature (Andersen 2001, Hougs 2005). Other reports of a second variant (ClinVar SCV000060036.4). In vitro studies show reduced force development and power output (Szczesna-Cordary 2004, Abraham 2009, Greenberg 2009, Greenberg 2010). [BS1 + BP5 + BP4]
44710	TCAP	c.458G>A	20	Likely Benign	7/8 missense algorithms predict benign. Only pathogenic in ClinVar by 'literature only'. Identified in siblings but no solid segregation data (Hayashi  2004). Functional studies in yeast show the variant leads to an increase in the ability of TCAP to bind with titin and CS-1 (Hayashi 2004)- in vitro assay may not accurately represent biological function.  Amino acid change is not conserved - 7 mammals carry the variant amino acid. [BS1 + BP4]
36601	MYBPC3	c.1321G>A	18	Likely Benign	Multiple reports of co-occurence with alternative pathogenic variants (ClinVar SCV000059030.4 and SCV000208011.4). Some computational modelling data suggest a confirmational effect (Gajendrarao 2015). [BS1 + BP5]
42775	MYBPC3	c.624G>C	18	VUS	Reports of possible non-segregation (ClinVar SCV000284248.1). [BS1]

Identified originally in cis with another MYH7 mutation in 2 siblings with HCM (Blair 2001) - other variant (c.1816G>A) is absent in ExAC and has been shown to segregate in multiple families (24 literature reports) [BS1 + BP2]
4243	MYLK2	c.260C>T	16	VUS	Pathogenic in ClinVar from 'literature only', no other submissions. Found as a compound het in a 13yr old and with an MYH7 variant (also in mildy affected parents; Davis (2001). Other compound het variant is also common. [BS1]
12197	VCL	c.2923C>T	16	VUS	Pathogenic in ClinVar from 'literature only' .Reduced levels of vinculin in the patient with this variant, but other studies found that this was a general feature of HCM and not related to specific genotypes (Vasile 2006). [BS1]
14122	MYH7	c.1322C>T	16	VUS	Pathogenic in ClinVar from 'literature only', in Laing distal myopathy. No change in mRNA levels. Amino acid is not conserved in mammals. [BS1]
30143	MYBPC3	c.2618C>A	13	VUS	Identified as a compound het and in homozygous state (consaguinous family; Nanni 2003, Ingles 2005). No segregation data in HCM. 1 homozygote seen in ExAC. [BS1]
31780	MYL3	c.170C>G	11	VUS	7/8 missense algorithms predict damaging. Functional study showing lowercomplex affinity not significant for this variant after multiple testing (Lossie 2012). Segregation in 5 affected members of 2 families (ClinVar SCV000199362.3). All reports in East Asians (highest ExAC frequency at 0.05%). [BS1 + PP3 + PP1]
45533	LDB3	c.1823C>T	11	VUS	Pathogenic in ClinVar from 'literature only'. No segregation or functional data. [BS1]
42679	MYBPC3	c.3049G>A	10	Likely Benign	Not conserved amino acid - 7/7 missense algorithms predict benign. No functional or segregation data. [BS1 + BP4]
9380	SCN5A	c.4534C>T	9	VUS	8/8 missense algorithms predict damaging. Reported in association with Brugada syndrome (Rook 1999, Deschnes 2000, Meregalli 2009, Crotti 2012). In vitro functional studies show a potential impact (Rook 1999, Deschnes 2000), however these may not be representative of in vivo protein function. [BS1 + PP3]
6055	KCNE2	c.79C>T	9	VUS	7/8 missense algorithms predict damaging. Identified in 2 Chinese families for Atrial Fibrillation (Yang 2004). Only parent and child tested for mutation (50% chance of segregation). An in vitro study on rat cardiomyocytes saw supression of L-type Calcium current (Liu 2014). [BS1 + PP3]

48097	LMNA	c.976T>A	7	Likely Benign	Position not conserved 7/8 missense algorithms predict benign, simulation studies suggest no effect on coil B dimerisation. [BS1 + BP4]
42566	MYBPC3	c.1786G>A	7	VUS	6/7 missense algorithms predict damaging. No clear segregation data (one suggestion the variant doesn't segregate (ClinVar SCV000259413.1)). [BS1 + PP3]
36613	MYBPC3	c.529C>T	6	Likely Benign	Different missense at the same position is common. Identified with another pathogenic MYBPC3 variant (ClinVar SCV000198969.3). Otherwise found in DCM. Position not well conserved. [BS1 + BP5]
